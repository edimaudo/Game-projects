Strumming Easy-ish
Clicking for each note is cool. My what if we change the interaction to .mouseover so that the mouse strums the surface?

Melody Maker Medium
After youâ€™ve changed the interaction to .mouseover, can you rearrange and duplicate the notes to make them into a melody or chord? Try changing their size and position as well.

Custom Soundboard Hard
Music notes are only one type of sound. Try finding other audio clips, or recording your own and adding them to the board. Maybe add pictures of where the sound came from to the boxes as well.
